# Beccas-Burgers
**Becca's Burger logger |  Built with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!)**

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the submitted burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. Hungyry? Click it, the burger will move to the right/"devoured" side of the page.
